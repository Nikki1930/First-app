# First-app 💡

Welcome to **First-app** — my very first Kotlin-based project using **Gradle**!  
This repository marks the beginning of my journey into app development, where I’m learning the fundamentals of **Kotlin**, **project structure**, and **build tools**. 🎉

## 🚀 What’s Inside

This is a very basic setup intended to explore how Kotlin projects are structured and built using Gradle.

### 🗂️ Project Structure

A quick look at the main folders and files:

.idea/ → Android Studio project settings (auto-generated)
app/ → Main application code (Kotlin source files, manifests, etc.)
gradle/ → Gradle wrapper files for build automation
.gitignore → Tells Git which files/folders to ignore
build.gradle.kts → Main Gradle build configuration (Kotlin DSL)
gradle.properties → Central configuration for Gradle
gradlew / gradlew.bat → Scripts to run Gradle on Unix/Windows
settings.gradle.kts → Gradle settings (project name, modules)

## 🛠️ Built With

- [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/)
- [Gradle](https://gradle.org/)
- [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## 🚧 Future Plans

- Add a simple UI using Jetpack Compose or XML  
- Implement basic navigation or form input  
- Explore data persistence (Room DB or SharedPreferences)  
- Improve app architecture (MVVM pattern)
